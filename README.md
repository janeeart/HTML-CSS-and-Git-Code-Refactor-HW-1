# HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor-HW-1

This is a modification of a website for a marketing agency. The purpose of the modification is to make the site more accessible so that the site is optimized for search engines.

## Description

In this project we improved a website without changing what it does. We made the website more accessible by adding alt tags to all images to ensure that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies. We also cleaned up the code by reducing redundancy and improving the readability of the code.
